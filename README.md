# Cplusplus_Puzzles
Fun C++ Puzzles!

Here you find small tasks (called puzzles to add the fun spice).
I give difficulty ratings from 1 (the easiest) to 5 (hell hard) to the tasks.
The puzzles are thematic categorized.
I also provide the solutions which seem to be optimal in my opinion.
Let me know if you have better solutions, then I learn from you.

Enjoy!

Cheers,

Jimbola
